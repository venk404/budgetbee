### Keyboard shortcuts.

We are slowly rolling out keyboard shortcuts for most of the functionalities on Budgetbee. After this update, you can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the app and add transactions.

### New date picker.

The default datepicker was not good enough. The new datepicker lets your pick
date by typing the date in the input field. You can still pick a date
from the calendar.
