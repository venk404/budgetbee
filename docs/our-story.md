# Our story

Budgetbee wasn't supposed to exist.

I have this obession with tracking everything. I felt excel was a bit too much. Plus, we lose our data all the time.

So I build budgetbee as an internal tool to help me manage my expenses. It started out as a terminal app (I love terminal apps), but I soon realised a website would have been better. I have using it for a while now.

One of my friends asked me to release it.

So I did.

## Is it for me?

Budgetbee is probably not for you. Really. Use excel. Or google sheets. Or any other spreadsheet software.

It's for a very niche audience - those who want to track their finances and don't mind their financial data being stored in someone else's server.

If you decide to use it, I promise you I'll keep your data safe and encrypted. I would try my best to make sure the free tier is all you need. Unless you're running some automations from MAKE.com, n8n or anything else, or you have a large amount of data, the free tier should be enough.

If you do purchase the pro version, thank you for your support.
