				Last updated April 20, 2025 This Cookie Policy explains how
				Budgetbee (&quot;<strong>Company</strong>,&quot; &quot;
				<strong>we</strong>,&quot; &quot;<strong>us</strong>,&quot; and
				&quot;<strong>our</strong>&quot;) uses cookies and similar
				technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at{" "}

				</a>{" "}
				(&quot;<strong>Website</strong>&quot;). It explains what these

			<h2 id="what-are-cookies-">What are cookies?</h2>
			<p>
				Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
				mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used
				by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to
				work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting
				information. Cookies set by the website owner (in this case,
				Budgetbee ) are called &quot;first-party cookies.&quot; Cookies
				set by parties other than the website owner are called
				&quot;third-party cookies.&quot; Third-party cookies enable
				third-party features or functionality to be provided on or
				through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and
				analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can
				recognize your computer both when it visits the website in
				question and also when it visits certain other websites.
			</p>
			<h2 id="why-do-we-use-cookies-">Why do we use cookies?</h2>
			<p>
				We use first- and third- party cookies for several reasons. Some
				cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our
				Website to operate, and we refer to these as
				&quot;essential&quot; or &quot;strictly necessary&quot; cookies.
				Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests
				of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties.
				Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising,
				analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail
				below.
			</p>
			<h2 id="how-can-i-control-cookies-">How can I control cookies?</h2>
			<p>
				You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject
				cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your
				preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent
				Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you
				accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they
				are strictly necessary to provide you with services. The Cookie
				Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on
				our Website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use
				our Website though your access to some functionality and areas
				of our Website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your
				web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. The specific
				types of first- and third-party cookies served through our
				Website and the purposes they perform are described in the table
				below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary
				depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):**{" "}

				What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
				website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to
				time, like web beacons (sometimes called &quot;tracking
				pixels&quot; or &quot;clear gifs&quot;). These are tiny graphics
				files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to
				recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an
				email including them . This allows us, for example, to monitor
				the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to
				another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand
				whether you have come to the website from an online
				advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve
				site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing
				campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on
				cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will
				impair their functioning.
			</p>
			<h2 id="do-you-use-flash-cookies-or-local-shared-objects-">
				Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Websites may also use so-called &quot;Flash Cookies&quot; (also
				known as Local Shared Objects or &quot;LSOs&quot;) to, among
				other things, collect and store information about your use of
				our services, fraud prevention, and for other site operations.
				If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you
				can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash
				Cookies storage using the tools contained in the{" "}
				<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">
					Website Storage Settings Panel
				</a>
				. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the{" "}
				<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">
					Global Storage Settings Panel
				</a>{" "}
				and following the instructions (which may include instructions
				that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies
				(referred to &quot;information&quot; on the Macromedia site),
				how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer
				without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how
				to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the
				operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that
				setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of
				Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some
				Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications
				used in connection with our services or online content.

				Do you serve targeted advertising?

				Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile
				device to serve advertising through our Website. These companies
				may use information about your visits to this and other websites
				in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and
				services that you may be interested in. They may also employ
				technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of
				advertisements. They can accomplish this by using cookies or web
				beacons to collect information about your visits to this and
				other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about
				goods and services of potential interest to you. The information
				collected through this process does not enable us or them to
				identify your name, contact details, or other details that
				directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
